# Knapsack

This repository solves the 0/1 Knapsack problem. It is a problem in
combinatorial optimization where We have a set of $n$ items, each one of 
these has a weight $w_i$ and a value $v_i$. We also have a knapsack with a 
maximum capacity of $W$. The goal is to select a subset of those items that 
are below or equal of the knapsack's capacity and at the same time maximize 
the sum of values.
